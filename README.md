COMP 2001 Trail service.

I will be creating the trailservice backend for a trail application. This will use API intergration and database selection. 

The tables with the stored data will be saved on a university supplied database, mine being COMP2001_WKeogh.

The API will be hosted on a Docker container. And interacted with using SWAGGER UI.

The microservice uses the auth API to issue a token in which a user can utlise to access cirtian restricted endpoints.
